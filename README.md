# Knowledge Project

## Description

This repository is a our second projet to manage our knowledge with  PHP MVC structure.

It uses some cool vendors/libraries such as Twig.


## Example 

An example (a basic list of items) is provided (you can load the *simple-mvc.sql* file in a test database). The accessible URLs are :

* Home page at [localhost:8000/](localhost:8000/)
* Shom all themes at [localhost:8000/theme](localhost:8000/theme)

You can find all these routes declared in the file `src/routes.php`. This is the very same file where you'll add your own new routes to the application.
